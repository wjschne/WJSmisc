# WJSmisc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The WJSmisc package is set of functions I find convenient to have readily available to me.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wjschne/WJSmisc")
```
## Example

I often need to create a normal distribution with a shaded region below a point.

```{r example}
library(WJSmisc)
plotnorm(95, mu = 100, sigma = 15)

```

```{r}
library(simstandard)
model <- "
A =~ 0.71 * A_1 + 0.91 * A_2 + 0.85 * A_3
B =~ 0.65 * B_1 + 0.90 * B_2 + 0.75 * B_3
A ~~ -0.2 * B
"

d <- sim_standardized(
  model, 
  latent = FALSE, 
  error = FALSE)
cor_heat(d, margins = 0.1)
```
